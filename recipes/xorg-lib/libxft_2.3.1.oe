SUMMARY = "XFt: X FreeType libary"

DESCRIPTION = "Xft was designed to provide good support for scalable \
fonts, and to do so efficiently.  Unlike the core fonts system, it \
supports features such as anti-aliasing and sub-pixel rasterisation. \
Perhaps more importantly, it gives applications full control over the \
way glyphs are rendered, making fine typesetting and WYSIWIG display \
possible. Finally, it allows applications to use fonts that are not \
installed system-wide for displaying documents with embedded fonts.  Xft \
is not compatible with the core fonts system: usage of Xft requires \
fairly extensive changes to toolkits (user-interface libraries)."
